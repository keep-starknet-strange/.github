**Keep StarkNet Strange** is the Exploration team at StarkWare. Our goal is to kickstart exciting projects and to work hands in hands with the community.
We believe this collaboration will help us to understand better the needs of the builders of our ecosystem.

We welcome project idea, feel free to submit yours [here](https://github.com/orgs/keep-starknet-strange/discussions/new?category=ideas).

The global pipeline of projects and idea can be checked [here](https://github.com/orgs/keep-starknet-strange/projects/3/views/1).

The only rule is that there is no rule, think out of the box and keep starknet strange!

All projects are fully open-sourced from day one. Enjoy and let's build together!
